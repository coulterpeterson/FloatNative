# FloatNative

A modern, native iOS/tvOS client for Floatplane with liquid glass UI design, background audio playback, playlists, enhanced LTT search, Picture-in-Picture support, and more.

## Features:
* Clean, streamlined, native iOS design
* Watch Later and Playlists (through supplementary API)
* "Enhanced LTT Search" (through supplementary API)
* Auto Re-Login
* Token login and QR code token login (to workaround the shut down V2 auth)
* Native Picture-in-Picture support
* Background play
* Video download
* Tappable timestamps
* Light/Dark mode
* iPad styles/support
* Full-featured tvOS app from same codebase
  * Long press menu
  * Custom player controls
* Screen stays awake during playback
* Pretty icon that supports clear/tinted variants
* Watch progress is saved very regularly
* Live support

## Key notes:
* FloatNative/Models/Generated are generated from the community FloatplaneAPI using the script `generate-api-models.sh`
* The community (FloatplaneAPI documentation)[https://jamamp.github.io/FloatplaneAPIDocs/SwaggerUI/] is super helpful, and when in doubt network inspector while logged into Floatplane.com is of course the best source of truth.
